## Core Features:

- Product Listing: Display fashion products with name, average rating, and 'product age' from the local CSV dataset.
- Product Detail View: Show detailed product information including name, image, rating, customer feedback, and sentiment analysis tags.
- AI Sentiment Analysis: Analyze customer feedback using AI to determine sentiment, emotion, and intent, and generate tags to be displayed on the item detail page.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant, fashion-forward purple (#9C27B0) to evoke creativity and style.
- Background color: Light grey (#F5F5F5), close to white, creating a clean and minimalist backdrop for product presentation.
- Accent color: A punchy, contrasting fuchsia (#E91E63) for call-to-action buttons and important UI elements.
- Headline font: 'Belleza', a sans-serif for a modern look that works with art, design, and fashion, and pairs well with shorter text and headlines; for body text, use 'Alegreya', a serif.
- Use simple, elegant icons to represent different departments and categories.
- Employ a card-based layout with rounded corners and subtle hover shadows for product displays, consistent with an Amazon-like aesthetic.
- Incorporate subtle animations and transitions to enhance user experience, such as smooth chart updates on filtering or product detail page transitions.
